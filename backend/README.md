1)a set of rules and protocols that allows two different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. 
2)A server is a powerful computer or software system on a network that manages, stores, and sends data, files, or applications to other devices.
3)A web server is a computer system and software that stores, processes, and delivers website content to users over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS, typically in response to browser requests.
4)A web client is a software application or device—most commonly a web browser like Chrome or Firefox—that acts as the user-side interface to the internet. 
5)is a, set of rules for transferring files on the World Wide Web, GeeksforGeeks notes.
6)The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a global, virtual, and interlinked system of information, comprising web pages, documents, and multimedia content accessible via the internet. It operates on the internet using HTTP protocols, allowing users to navigate through interconnected hyperlinks, making it a system 
7)Frontend-React.js,TypeScript,Vite
8)Backend-Flask,Node.js,Express.Js
9)Statelessness in a REST API is an architectural constraint requiring that each client request to the server be an independent, self-contained transaction, unrelated to any previous requests. 

10)A REST API  utilizes standard HTTP methods to facilitate communication between different software systems. 
11)The rules of a REST API are scalability, simplicity, and independent evolution of client and server applications

12)using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) over the HTTP protocol. The frontend initiates requests, and the backend processes them and sends back responses.

13)An API endpoint is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) where an API (Application Programming Interface) receives requests and sends responses. It is the digital location that serves as the entry point for communication between different software systems
